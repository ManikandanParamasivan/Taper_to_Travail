	Project Description 
***This a simulation based project havn't made it on real by me***
This project works on a clap based signal to turn on any device you might to connected to the relay 
It is powered by a PIC Microcontroller(PIC16F84A) and i have used a buzzer on the simulation 
but if you are making in real sceniro then use a mic and i havn't connnected any device to the relay in the simulation too
since i Can't recieve a signal through a buzzer so actually the simulation is given to you so that you can get a brief idea 
how the circuit actually works.
